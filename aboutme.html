                <p id="lifestory">Born and raised in Brooklyn New York, ever since I was a child I had a passion for computers. I was always surrounded by my dad's computers and gaming 
                consoles, and was fascinated when hew would fix and/or modify his hardware. Although I did not start programming until I was in college, I was always fascinated by it.
                Once I was able to start learning software development and coding, I have been trying to learn different ways of applying my skills, with everything from writing games,
                creating websites(at least trying to), and maintaining cloud servers and computing.</p>
